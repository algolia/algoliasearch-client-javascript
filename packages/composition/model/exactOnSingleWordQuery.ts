/**
 * Determines how the [Exact ranking criterion](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/override-search-engine-defaults/in-depth/adjust-exact-settings/#turn-off-exact-for-some-attributes) is computed when the search query has only one word.  - `attribute`.   The Exact ranking criterion is 1 if the query word and attribute value are the same.   For example, a search for \"road\" will match the value \"road\", but not \"road trip\".  - `none`.   The Exact ranking criterion is ignored on single-word searches.  - `word`.   The Exact ranking criterion is 1 if the query word is found in the attribute value.   The query word must have at least 3 characters and must not be a stop word.   Only exact matches will be highlighted,   partial and prefix matches won\'t.
