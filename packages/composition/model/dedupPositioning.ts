/**
 * Deduplication positioning configures how a duplicate result should be resolved between an injected item and main search results. Current configuration supports: - \'highest\': always select the item in the highest position, and remove duplicates that appear lower in the results. - \'highestInjected\': duplicate result will be moved to its highest possible injected position, but not higher.    If a duplicate appears higher in main search results, it will be removed to stay it\'s intended group position (which could be lower than main).
