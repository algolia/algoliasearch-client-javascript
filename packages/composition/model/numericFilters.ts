 * Filter by numeric facets.  **Prefer using the `filters` parameter, which supports all filter types and combinations with boolean operators.**  You can use numeric comparison operators: `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`. Comparisons are precise up to 3 decimals. You can also provide ranges: `facet:<lower> TO <upper>`. The range includes the lower and upper boundaries. The same combination rules apply as for `facetFilters`.
