   * Filter expression to only include items that match the filter criteria in the response.  You can use these filter expressions:  - **Numeric filters.** `<facet> <op> <number>`, where `<op>` is one of `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`. - **Ranges.** `<facet>:<lower> TO <upper>`, where `<lower>` and `<upper>` are the lower and upper limits of the range (inclusive). - **Facet filters.** `<facet>:<value>`, where `<facet>` is a facet attribute (case-sensitive) and `<value>` a facet value. - **Tag filters.** `_tags:<value>` or just `<value>` (case-sensitive). - **Boolean filters.** `<facet>: true | false`.  You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:  - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can\'t use `NOT` with combinations of filters.   **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can\'t combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`  Use quotes if the facet attribute name or facet value contains spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.  For more information, see [Filters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering).
