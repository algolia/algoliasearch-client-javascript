You can combine filters with `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators with the following restrictions:  - You can only combine filters of the same type with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR num > 3`. - You can\'t use `NOT` with combinations of filters.   **Not supported:** `NOT(facet:value OR facet:value)` - You can\'t combine conjunctions (`AND`) with `OR`.   **Not supported:** `facet:value OR (facet:value AND facet:value)`  Use quotes around your filters, if the facet attribute name or facet value has spaces, keywords (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`), or quotes. If a facet attribute is an array, the filter matches if it matches at least one element of the array.
