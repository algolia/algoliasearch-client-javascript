 * Maximum radius for a search around a central location.  This parameter works in combination with the `aroundLatLng` and `aroundLatLngViaIP` parameters. By default, the search radius is determined automatically from the density of hits around the central location. The search radius is small if there are many hits close to the central coordinates.
