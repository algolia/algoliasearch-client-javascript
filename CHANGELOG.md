CHANGELOG

2017-02-08 3.21.1
 * fix(browse*): use POST instead of GET to avoid limits (#503)

2017-02-06 3.21.0
 * feat(x-algolia-agent): specify x-algolia-agent at search time
 * fix(parse): check for `global` existence before erasing

2017-01-16 3.20.4

  * fix(retry strategy): handle cases were localStorage fails after success (#474)

    Before this commit we only checked for localStorage failures at:
    - page load
    - localStorage.setItem

    While in some situations websites could erase localStorage for the
    whole page at any moment (between requests) and we were not resilient to that.

  * chore(forwardToSlave): deprecate forwardToSlaves in favour or forwardToReplicas

2017-01-04 3.20.3

  * fix(agent): ensure algolia agent is not duplicated by successive calls

2016-12-19 3.20.2

  * fix(nodejs): do not use let, 0.12 does not support it

2016-12-17 3.20.1

  * fix(nodejs): on timeout, destroy the right response

2016-12-14 3.20.0

  * feat(retry strategy): adjust retry strategy for all implementations
    - Retry strategy now shares the last known host for a specific appId across the current domain (browsers)
    or the current process (browsers without localStorage, Node.js). After 2 minutes we try to target back
    the first host (Usually DSN)
    - Retry strategy now shares the last known timeout multiplier that worked and set it back to default
    after 2 minutes
    - Retry strategy on Node.js now has a connect timeout of 2s
    - Retry strategy on browsers (JavaScript, not jQuery, not Angular.js, not React Native for now) now
    has a connect timeout of 1s
    - You can now get and set timeouts per client with .setTimeouts({connect, read, write}), .getTimeouts().
    Values are in ms.

    fixes #232
  * fix(json): avoid throwing when late JSON response
    fixes #284
  * fix(nodejs): allow universal lite applications
    require('algoliasearch/lite') should work to
    facilitate universal applications builds using
    the lite build on frontend

fixes #283

2016-06-07 3.15.0

  * feat(synonyms): add new synonyms API

2016-05-30 3.14.6

  * fix(places): allow empty credentials

2016-05-26 3.14.5

  * fix(window): don't assume window is here

  When required in a node context, we may load the browser build without
  using it. Just for testing other parts of it.

2016-05-25 3.14.4

  * fix(lite): lite package should have browse and browseFrom

2016-05-25 3.14.3

  * fix(retry): also retry on non search methods when DNS failure

    Before this commit, methods with no fallback support (basically every
    method) would fail at retry if the DNS error occured before the API
    client timeout.

    The behavior is now:
    - when a method with a fallback errors because of DNS failure we will
    switch to JSONP right away
    - when a method with no fallback errors because of DNS failure we will
    still retry

    We could use the same mechanism for both (= always try all hosts
    before JSONP) but I am not confident doing this change within a patch
    or minor version. We have too litle data on how blocked XHRS are
    triggered (async, sync?).

    fixes #250

    * fix(request strategy): comply with retry spec, no early JSONP switch

      This commit brings more conformance with request strategy
      specification by only raising timeout when there's a timeout.

      It also stop trying to switch to JSONP asap and always try all hosts
      using XHRS before.

2016-05-24 3.14.2

  * fix(request strategy): increments hostIndex (host adress) on fallback

    When we are switching to fallback, increment host index so that JSONP
    will use another host.

    This issue was caused because we cannot distinguish CORS errors from DNS
    resolution errors in the browser.

    And the code for incrementing the host index was moved into the part
    that switches to the fallback in
    4ec5e6a1f8cd92924ce025d60646b3a47b7d8dca.

    Truth is that the current solution is not optimal as, in the browser,
    we are switching to JSONP when we can't resolve the server name.

    This is only done because we are not sure how CORS request can be
    blocked (synchronously, asynchronously).

    In a next version we would drop it and wait for real issues to show up.

2016-05-12 3.14.1

  * fix(retry strategy): retry on timeout was only using two hosts
  * fix(errors): provide err.debugData with necessary debugging information
  * fix(errors): force AlgoliaSearchError as default name
  fixes #241

2016-05-04 3.14.0

  * feat(client.search): add strategy, fixes #208
  * fix(shuffle): shuffle host array like we did
  * feat(filesize): reduce filesize by removing lodash
    All build size down 26% (20kb => 14kb)
    New search-only build "algoliasearchLite[.min].js",
    weights 9.5Kb (down 50% from normal build)
    Also available as require('algoliasearch/lite');
  * fix(parse): handle parse cloud env having process.env defined

2016-03-24 3.13.1

  * chore(dev): use phantomjs-prebuilt instead of phantomjs
  fixes #209

2016-02-23 3.13.0

  * feat(initPlaces): add a static algoliasearch.initPlaces method

2016-02-05 3.12.0

  * fix(apiKey): put the apiKey in the POST body when feasible and key > 500 chars
  * feat(falback): provide opts.useFallback to avoid using JSONP fallback

2016-01-28 3.11.0

  * feat(partialUpdateObject): add createIfNotExists option: partialUpdateObject(object, createIfNotExists) https://www.algolia.com/doc/rest#partially-update-an-object
  * chore(dev): various fixes to the dev env

2015-12-14 3.10.2

  * fix(request strategy): always use XHR first then switch to fallback

    + add fallback for client.search

    Context: before this commit, when a user lost connectivity (or XHR was
    blocked, we cannot distinguish those events in browsers) then we
    forced using JSONP for the whole session.

    This led to a bug where you were stuck in a loop of non-available
    fallback even if connectivity was restored.

    This commit fixes this bug by always trying XHRS and fallbacking to
    JSONP on a per request basis.
  * refactor(map): use lodash map instead of custom fn

2015-12-11 3.10.1
    * fix(nodejs): consistent timeouts between nodejs versions
      We now use basic setTimeout functionnality instead of
      req.setTimeout in nodejs to avoid inconsistencies between nodejs engines.
      In node 0.10, req.setTimeout was a socket inactivity timeout
      In node > 0.10? req.setTimeout is now a global timeout
      + Node.js timeout is now 30s global per request (then incremental)
      + Fixed an edge case where we had an uncaught exception in nodejs
      + We only support 0.10+ now, node 0.8 never worked

2015-12-08 3.10.0

      will now wait 100ms * loopTickNumber * loopTickNumber
      fixes #102
    * fix: do not use global when we know we will be in a browser
      browserify `global` is not always `window` can be <div id="global"></div>
      fixes #99
    * feat: new browse()/browseFrom()/browseAll()
      - `browse(query, queryParameters)` now has the same signature than
      search(). You can use any `query` and `queryParameters`.
      - `browseFrom(cursor)` can be used as an efficient way to
      continue (next page) a previous `browse()` call. All browse responses now have a `cursor` property.
      - `browseAll(query, queryParameters)` can be used to get all
      the content of your index
        It returns an [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html).

        Available events:
          - `result`
          - `end`
          - `error` (you should listen to it or it will throw)

        There's also `stop()` method on the event emitter so that you can
        stop browsing at any point.

      fixes #101
    * fix: support typeahead 0.11
      fixes #105

    * test: add integration testing and rework the travis tasks

2015-05-14  3.3.2

2015-05-12  3.3.1
    * FIX: Compatibility with AngularJS old promise implementation
      We now use $q.defer() instead of $q()

2015-05-12  3.3.0
    * FEATURE: expose window.algoliasearch = algoliasearch in jquery/angular plugins. So that
    you can use the original algoliasearch() implem in plugins. Otherwise you would have to load both

2015-05-11  3.2.4
    * FIX: 15s inactivity timeout for nodejs implementation, should help high latency/low connection users
    * CHORE: test on iojs2

2015-05-06  3.2.2
    * FIX :  missing require (crypto) for node.js client (#84)

2015-04-29  3.2.1
    * add dist/ to npmjs repository, so cdnjs autoupdate works

2015-04-24  3.2.0
    * FEATURE: Parse build now uses V3 implementation
    * FEATURE: Parse build now returns parse promises. https://parse.com/docs/js_guide#promises
    * FEATURE: Automatically handle HTTP_PROXY HTTPS_PROXY environment variables
    in Node.js client

2015-04-14  3.1.0
    * CHANGE: Node.js will now use http headers instead of inlining them into the api call as browsers are doing
    * CHANGE: Ensure all headers (http, querystrings) are lowercased. Both are supported by our API, reduces FUD
    * FEATURE: add index.getObjects()
    * FEATURE: add index.deleteObjects()
    * FIX: waitTask failure case when using promises, was not going through
    * FEATURE: add index.deleteByQuery()
    * FEATURE (Node.js): add client.enableRateLimitForward()
    * FEATURE (Node.js): add client.disableRateLimitForward()
    * FEATURE (Node.js): add client.useSecuredAPIKey()
    * FEATURE (Node.js): add client.disableSecuredAPIKey()
    * BREAKING CHANGE (Node.js): client.setTimeout renamed to client.setRequestTimeout
    * TEST: add test around setRequestTimeout
    * FEATURE (Node.js): add client.generateSecuredApiKey()
    * FEATURE:
      - all clients are now exposing algoliasearch.ua
      - all requests are now sending x-user-agent containing for example 'Algoliasearch for vanilla JavaScript 3.0.7'
    * FEATURE: add client.search()
      Search against multiple indices, equivalent of, multipleQueries, or
      startQueriesBatch+addQueryInBatch+sendQueriesBatch
    * BREAKING CHANGE (Node.js): removed client.multipleQueries(), use client.search(queries)
    * DEPRECIATION (browser): client.startQueriesBatch/addQueryInBatch/sendQueriesBatch
      Use client.search(queries)
    * FEATURE: new HA implementation
      We now use two different DNS to perform all requests
      Removed the tld option as it's no more needed nor compatible with having a new HA implementation with different tlds (.com/.net)
    * DEPRECIATION: client.addUserKeyWithValidity(), index.addUserKeyWithValidity()
      You can now use client.addUserKey(acls, params, cb), index.addUserKey(acls, params, cb)
    * FEATURE: client|index.updateUserKey(key, acls, params, callback)
      Update a user key, provide acls and optional params
    * BREAKING CHANGE (Node.js):
      As we now have addUserKey and updateUserKey, we removed:
       - client|index.addUserKeyWithValidityAndIndexes
       - client|index.updateUserKeyWithValidity
       - client|index.updateUserKeyWithValidityAndIndexes
      You can use client|index.addUserKey or client|index.updateUserKey to do
      deal with all you keys needs

2015-04-10  3.0.7
    * MIGRATION: throw on V2 .search() usage:
      - .search(query, cb, params)
      - .search(cb, params)
    * FEATURE: add client.destroy() in Node.js implementation
      will destroy all keepalived connections and let the process exits if needed

2015-04-03  3.0.6
    * FIX: Webpack compatibility by removing packageify
      webpack does not interprets for now node_modules/* browserify transforms
    * MISC: add release script

2015-04-02  3.0.5
    * FIX: lower the build size by requiring the good version/browser.js in browser
      builds. Previously we got the full `package.json` inlined

2015-04-02  3.0.4
    * FIX: Defaults to http when the protocol of the page is not http or
      https
    * FIX: XDomainRequests no more aborted in IE9 #76

2015-03-28  3.0.3

    * FIX: Handle module loaders + cdn.jsdelivr.net/algoliasearch/latest usage
      When in this situation, the module loader would prevent the code
      detecting and loading the V2 to execute.
      Now fixed by prepending the migration-layer to the browserify bundle.
      It also removes the migration-layer code from the package managers (npm, bower) builds,
      where it makes no sense to have it
    * FIX: load V2 using a DOMElement when V3 is loaded ASYNCHRONOUSLY with /latest/
      * tested on all majors browsers:
        Chrome stable
        Firefox stable
        IE 8, 9, 10, 11
      * tested on correponding customer websites
    * FIX: better warning messages when using `latest` or trying to use V3 as V2

2015-03-26  3.0.2

    * temp /latest/ fix for some clients loading /latest/ in async mode

2015-03-26  3.0.1

    * fix npm usage, was missing a dependency

2015-03-25  3.0.0
    * V2 users, see the migration guide at https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js/wiki/Migration-guide-from-2.x.x-to-3.x.x
    * BREAKING CHANGES:
      * `new AlgoliaSearch()` => `algoliasearch()` #40
        - The only exported global property is now `algoliasearch`
        - `opts`:
          - `dsnHost` removed, use `hosts:[dsnHost, other hosts]`
          - `dsn` removed, use `hosts:[non-dsn-host, non-dsn-host]`
          - `requestTimeoutInMs` renamed to `timeout`
          - `method` renamed to `protocol`. Protocol should be specified as `http:` or `https:`
          - `hosts` behavior changed, when using custom hosts:
            - no shuffling
            - no dsn host is prepended to the list
        - removed `AlgoliaExplainResults`, no obvious use ATM
        - calling algoliasearch() without an applicationID or apiKey will throw
        - Helper: `new AlgoliaSearchHelper()` => `algoliasearch.helper()`, same function signature
      * no more window.ALGOLIA_VERSION
        - you can find the version in algoliasearch.version
      * all api methods now use the (err, content) convention #43
        It means that instead of doing:
          ```js
            index.search(function found(success, content) {
              if (!success) {
                console.log('Error was:', content);
                return;
              }

              console.log('OK!', content);
            });
          ```
        You must do:
          ```js
            index.search(function found(err, content) {
              if (err) {
                console.log('Error was:', err);
                return;
              }

              console.log('OK!', content);
            });
          ```
        This is in par with most asynchronous APIS accepted/de vfacto conventions.
        It helps being compatible with control flow libraries like `async` and
        helps reduce WTF moments of Node.JS developers used to cb(err, content)
      * client.getLogs(cb[, offset, length]) is now .getLogs([offset, length, cb])
      * client.listIndexes(cb[, page]) => .listIndexes([page, cb])
      * client|index.addUserKeyWithValidity(acls, validity, maxQueriesPerIPPerHour, maxHitsPerQuery, cb) => client|index.addUserKeyWithValidity(acls, params, cb) where params = {validity:, maxQueriesPerIPPerHour:, maxHitsPerQuery:}
      * client.sendQueriesBatch(cb, delay) => client.sendQueriesBatch(cb)
      * index.addObject(content[, callback, objectID]) => index.addObject(content[, objectID, callback])
      * index.getObject(objectID[, callback, attributes]) => index.getObject(objectID[, attrs, callback])
      * index.search(query, callback[, params, delay]) => index.search(query[, params callback]) or index.search(params[, cb]) with params = {query: 'some thing'}
        We removed the delay option which should really be implemented by the module consumer. It's really a throttle/debounce of the search functions
      * index.browse(page, cb[, hitsPerPage]) => index.browse(page[, hitsPerPage, cb])
      * no more opts.jsonp in algoliasearch()
        Previously used as a way to force/disable jsonp. The request strategy is now more robust and does not
        requires jsonp: param
      * JSON2.js is no more included in the main build.
        If you need to support IE7 <= or IE8 quirks, add this:
          ```html
          <!--[if lte IE 7]>
          <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/json2/0.2/json2.min.js"></script>
          <![endif]-->
          ```
      * removed AlgoliaSearchHelper
        Please see https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-helper-js if you need the helper
    * NEW FEATURES:
      * UMD compatibiliy #41
        - algoliasearch can now be used with any module loader
        - build is now done with browserify
        - no more grunt
      * All calls are now returning promises #45
        If there's a callback given to an API call, you won't get a promise.
        Here are the different promises implementations we use:
        - Native promises by default (https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise/)
        - AngularJS promises for AngularJS plugin
        - jQuery promises for jQuery plugin
    * FIXES:
      * do not retry when server sends 4xx or 1xx
      * distinguish jQuery/AngularJS request timeouts from errors and thus retry when timeout
      * JSONP fallback when jQuery/AngularJS request error
    * MISC:
      * Externalize plugins and request implementations
      * some linting fixes
      * test suite, including request strategy test suite
      * IE10 should now behave as a CORS supported XMLHttpRequest browser, as it is
      * running tests on many browsers, using saucelabs
      * removed vendor/
        - vendor/json2.js
        - vendor/jquery.typeahead.js now on cdnjs (examples)
