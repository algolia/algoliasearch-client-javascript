  description: >
    Search for userIDs.

    The data returned will usually be a few seconds behind real time, because userID usage may take up to a few seconds propagate to the different clusters.

    To keep updates moving quickly, the index of userIDs isn't built synchronously with the mapping. Instead, the index is built once every 12h, at the same time as the update of userID usage. For example, when you perform a modification like adding or moving a userID, the search will report an outdated value until the next rebuild of the mapping, which takes place every 12h.

    Upon success, the response is 200 OK and contains the following userIDs data.
